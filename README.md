# Tiling Polyominoes Game 
This project is a game which the user can drag the polyominoes to complete the puzzle (shaded area) that is being generated by the program. In short, it is similar to the game, [Tangram](https://www.mathplayground.com/mobile/tangram_fullscreen.htm). 

## Design
The most important part of this project is the algorithm that randomly generates the puzzle each time the user requests a new game. We utitlize the `Tile` class to keep track to the color of the current tile that we are looking at. The algorithm picks a random position in a 8x8 board, and goes to either right, left, up, or down to get to the next piece of a polyomino until it reaches 8 tiles. During the process of making a polyomino, there is a visited list so that the algorithm doesn't check the select the block that is already visited. After one is done, a while loop handles to generate 4 different polyominoes. With our view implementations, the canvas displays the board with shaded area on the left as well as a collection of polymonioes on the right. We also enable the functionality to show solution, hide solution, or acquire a new puzzle.
